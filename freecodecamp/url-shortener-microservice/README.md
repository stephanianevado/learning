# [URL Shortener Microservice](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/back-end-development-and-apis-projects/url-shortener-microservice)
This is my third test after finishing the freeCodeCamp online course about Back End Development and APIs. The test had the following requirements:

- You should provide your own project, not the example URL.

- You can POST a URL to /api/shorturl and get a JSON response with original_url and short_url properties. Here's an example: { original_url : 'https://freeCodeCamp.org', short_url : 1}

- When you visit /api/shorturl/<short_url>, you will be redirected to the original URL.

- If you pass an invalid URL that doesn't follow the valid http://www.example.com format, the JSON response will contain { error: 'invalid url' }
