# [Introduction to the Basic Node and Express Challenges](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/basic-node-and-express/)

I had to follow this instructions for the course about Basic Node and Express:

- Clone this GitHub repo and complete these challenges locally.
- Use our Replit starter project to complete these challenges.
- Use a site builder of your choice to complete the project. Be sure to incorporate all the files from our GitHub repo.
- During the development process, it is important to be able to check whatâ€™s going on in your code.

Node is just a JavaScript environment. Like client side JavaScript, you can use the console to display useful debug information. On your local machine, you would see console output in a terminal. On Replit, a terminal is open in the right pane by default.

We recommend to keep the terminal open while working at these challenges. By reading the output in the terminal, you can see any errors that may occur.
