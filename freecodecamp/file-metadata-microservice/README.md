# [File Metadata Microservice](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/file-metadata-microservice)

This is my fith test after finishing the freeCodeCamp online course about Back End Development and APIs. The test had the following requirements:

- You should provide your own project, not the example URL.

- You can submit a form that includes a file upload.

- The form file input field has the name attribute set to upfile.

- When you submit a file, you receive the file name, type, and size in bytes within the JSON response.

After completed the five web programming projects I earned my Back End Development and APIs certification <3
