# boilerplate-npm
A boilerplate for the freeCodeCamp curriculum.

I had to follow this instructions for the course about Managing Packages with NPM:

- Clone this GitHub repo and complete these challenges locally.
- Use our Replit starter project to complete these challenges.
- Use a site builder of your choice to complete the project. Be sure to incorporate all the files from our GitHub repo.
