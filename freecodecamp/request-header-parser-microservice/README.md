# [Request Header Parser Microservice](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/request-header-parser-microservice)

This is my second test after finishing the freeCodeCamp online course about Back End Development and APIs. The test had the following requirements:

- You should provide your own project, not the example URL.

- A request to /api/whoami should return a JSON object with your IP address in the ipaddress key.

- A request to /api/whoami should return a JSON object with your preferred language in the language key.

- A request to /api/whoami should return a JSON object with your software in the software key.
