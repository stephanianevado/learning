# Learning material for web development
In this repository I've collected material from different online courses that I've taken to learn web development.

## Domestika
This is the first course that I took for leaning some basic concepts about HTML and CSS.

## freeCodeCamp
At freeCodeCamp I've taken different courses for learning frontend programming. At the end of each course there's a project and I've collected them in this folder. Below is a list of the projects that I did:

* Build a tribute page.
* Build a survey form.
* Build a product landing page.
* Build a technical documentation page.
* Build a personal portfolio webpage.
* Build a random quote machine.
* Build a markdown previewer.
* Build a drum machine.
