# Learning material for web development
In this repository I've collected material from different online courses that I've taken to learn web development.

## Domestika
This is the first course that I took for leaning some basic concepts about HTML and CSS.

## freeCodeCamp
At freeCodeCamp I've taken different courses for learning frontend programming. At the end of each course there's a project and I've collected them in this folder. Below is a list of the projects that I did:

* Build a tribute page.
* Build a survey form.
* Build a product landing page.
* Build a technical documentation page.
* Build a personal portfolio webpage.
* Build a random quote machine.
* Build a markdown previewer.
* Build a drum machine.
* Build a javascript calculator.
* Build a 25 + 5 clock.
* Back End Development and APIs Courses: boilerplate-npm, boilerplate-express, boilerplate-mongomongoose.
* Build a timestamp microservice.

Note: I also built a star wars music machine as an alternative to the original project "drum machine", just because I'm a big fan <3!!
